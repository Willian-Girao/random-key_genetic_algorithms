# Random-Key Genetic Algorithms

## Introduction
Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (RKGA) is a new class of John Holland's Genetic Algorithms (GA). This new class described by Bean[6] works by representing the possible solutions of an optimization problem as permutation vectors composed of random keys.

## Overview
A random-key genetic algorithm (RKGA) is an evolutionary metaheuristic for discrete and global optimization. Each solution is encoded as an array og *n* random keys where a random key is a real number, randomly generated, in the continuous interval [0,1).

A decoder maps each array of random keys to a solution of the optimization problem being solved and computes its cost.

The algorithm starts with a population of *p* arrays of random keys. At each iteration, the arrays are partitioned into two sets: a smaller set of high-valued elite solutions and the remaining non-elite solutions forming another set.

All elite elements are copied, without change, to the next population. A small number of random-key arrays (the mutants) are added to the population of the next iteration. The remaining elements of the population of the next iteration are generated by combining, with parametrized uniform crossover of Spears and DeJong (On the virtues of parameterized uniform crossover. In: Proceedings of the fourth international conference on genetic algorithms, San Mateo, pp 230–236, 1991), paris of arrays.

## Decoder
The decoder proposed by Bean [6] simply orders the elements of the vector of random keys, thus producing a permutation corresponding to the indices of the sorted elements.
